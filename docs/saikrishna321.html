<p>Hi! I‚Äôm Sai Krishna (Director of Engineering, LambdaTest), an Open Source contributor and maintainer with over a decade of experience. My journey began as an OSS user, overcoming the difficulties associated with mobile test automation. Witnessing firsthand how Open Source tools empower the community sparked a deep interest in giving back. That‚Äôs where my journey truly started. Since then, I‚Äôve contributed to and maintained key projects like Appium, co-created tools like AppiumTestDistribution (ATD), and actively mentored the next generation of testers. For me, Open Source isn‚Äôt just about code. It‚Äôs about creating impact through community collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-get-involved-with-open-source"><strong>1. How did you get involved with Open Source?</strong></h2>
<p>Like many others, I started as an Open Source user. As I relied on tools like Appium in my day-to-day testing efforts, I realized how these community-built tools made life easier for so many. That realization inspired me to contribute back. I began small, triaging issues and writing documentation, and gradually moved toward contributing code. Over time, I got involved in projects like Appium, Selenium, and ATD, eventually taking on maintainer roles to help shape the direction of the tools I once just used.</p>
<h2 id="whats-open-source-to-you"><strong>2. What‚Äôs Open Source to you?</strong></h2>
<p>Open Source is a shared responsibility and a powerful force for innovation. It‚Äôs not just about software. It‚Äôs about enabling communities to solve problems together. Whether it‚Äôs writing code, reviewing pull requests, improving documentation, or guiding a first-time contributor, Open Source thrives when we build with the community, not just for it.</p>
<h2 id="what-projects-are-you-involved-in"><strong>3. What projects are you involved in?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Appium Java Client</strong>: Focused on plugin architecture and improving parallel test support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AppiumTestDistribution (ATD)</strong>: Co-created to address parallel execution challenges in mobile and IoT testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Selenium / Taiko</strong>: Contributed to enhancing developer ergonomics and cross-browser testing stability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appium Plugins</strong>: Developed several plugins to simplify and extend Appium capabilities:<br />
‚Ä¢ Appium Device Farm<br />
‚Ä¢ Appium Gestures Plugin<br />
‚Ä¢ Appium Wait Plugin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appium Conference</strong>: Active participant and advocate for sharing best practices and building global tester communities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-grow-your-community"><strong>4. How do you grow your community?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Listen and Adapt</strong>: ATD was shaped by community feedback, such as adding remote device execution support for distributed teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplify Onboarding</strong>: Built tools like <code>appium-installer</code> to make setup easy for newcomers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerate Go to Market</strong>: Appium Device Farm enables organizations to quickly set up scalable mobile device grids for automated testing. This helps improve device coverage, accelerate feedback, and reduce time to market.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Events and Outreach</strong>: Conduct webinars, workshops, and community calls to connect with testers and developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation First</strong>: Clear and actionable guides are a top priority to help contributors ramp up quickly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-challenges-as-a-maintainer"><strong>5. Main Challenges as a Maintainer</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Burnout and Sustainability</strong>: Balancing a full-time job with OSS commitments requires careful management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Debt</strong>: Evolving architectures while keeping backward compatibility is complex.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Oversight</strong>: Staying ahead of vulnerabilities in dependencies is a continuous effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Succession Planning</strong>: Building a pipeline of contributors who can take over when needed is essential for long-term project health.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-contributors-can-support-maintainers"><strong>6. How Contributors Can Support Maintainers</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Non-Code Help</strong>: Contribute to documentation, triage issues, or mentor first-time contributors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sponsorships</strong>: Encourage organizations to support OSS via GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be Proactive</strong>: Submit detailed bug reports and well-crafted pull requests, and respect maintainers‚Äô time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Mindset</strong>: Assist with implementing reproducible builds, static analysis tools, and secure development pipelines.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-security-practices"><strong>7. Key Security Practices</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Automated Scanning</strong>: Integrated static analysis and dependency scanning into CI/CD workflows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manual Reviews</strong>: Maintained strong code review practices to catch subtle vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reproducible Builds</strong>: Adopted to ensure traceability and auditability across key projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Awareness</strong>: Hosted regular sessions on secure coding and testing for mobile and web ecosystems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-of-ai-on-open-source"><strong>8. Impact of AI on Open Source</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Faster Innovation</strong>: AI tools like code assistants and CI copilots boost productivity and accessibility in Open Source.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Risks</strong>: AI-generated code introduces concerns around licensing, bias, and reproducibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upskilling</strong>: Developers with AI and Open Source experience are in high demand. AI knowledge is becoming essential for modern maintainers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advice-for-maintainers"><strong>9. Advice for Maintainers</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mentor Early</strong>: Invest time in contributors who can grow into future maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Metrics</strong>: Track pull request volume, response time, and contributor engagement to identify gaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automate Everything</strong>: Leverage bots, scripts, and CI tools to reduce fatigue and focus on strategic efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be Community-Driven</strong>: Focus on solving real pain points. ATD succeeded by addressing everyday mobile testing challenges.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Open Source is built on invisible work: code reviews, mentorship, documentation, and triage. That work deserves recognition and support. As the landscape evolves and AI plays a bigger role, maintainers must innovate while staying sustainable and inclusive. The future of Open Source depends on shared responsibility and visible maintainership.</p>
