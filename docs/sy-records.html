    <p>
      I‚Äôm Luffy, a full-stack developer passionate about Open Source. You can
      find me on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sy-records">@sy-records</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before getting involved with Open Source, I was just an ordinary software
      user and a PHP developer, knowing little about the communities,
      collaboration, or the idea of contributing behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time passed, I gradually realized that Open Source is not just a
      collection of technologies ‚Äî it‚Äôs also an extension of values and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created projects like Simps and
      <a href="https://github.com/simps/mqtt">PHPMQTT</a>, and actively
      contributed to several Open Source projects including
      <a href="https://github.com/docsifyjs">Docsify</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/hyperf">Hyperf</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/swoole">Swoole</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/typecho">Typecho</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/apache/answer">Apache Answer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From being a user to becoming a contributor, and eventually a maintainer
      of Open Source projects, this journey has profoundly changed my career
      path and shaped my understanding of the tech world.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-did-you-get-involved-with-open-source">
      How did you get involved with Open Source?
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 2019, I joined the Swoole Open Source project and began working on a
      documentation overhaul.
    </p>
    <p>
      This involved not only redesigning the front-end UI but also correcting
      outdated content and adding more sample code.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the process, I encountered some issues: the new documentation was
      built using docsify, which at that time had some long standing
      search-related problems, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unable to search content within tables</li>
      <li>Incorrect scroll position when clicking search results</li>
      <li>Inability to search list content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I started by submitting issues to the docsify repository to see if the
      maintainers could address them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving responses, I found time to submit PRs with fixes, which
      were fortunately merged smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through continued contributions to docsify, I was eventually invited to
      join the core team, and today, I am proud to be an owner of the docsify
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing the Swoole documentation overhaul, I also helped promote
      docsify ‚Äî leading to its adoption by organizations like Hyperf, OpenMix,
      and ApolloConfig for their documentation needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my understanding of Open Source deepened, I gradually moved from simply
      fixing bugs to contributing code and improving documentation across
      projects, eventually becoming a maintainer for several of them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whats-open-source-to-you">What‚Äôs Open Source to you?</h2>
    <p>For me, Open Source is both a passion and a beginning.</p>
    <p>It‚Äôs not just a technical practice ‚Äî it represents a set of values.</p>
    <p>It stands for openness, sharing, and collaboration.</p>
    <p>
      By participating in Open Source, I have not only improved my technical
      skills but also met many like-minded friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, Open Source has given me a profound sense of belonging
      and achievement.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-projects-are-you-involved-in">
      What projects are you involved in?
    </h2>
    <p>Recently, I‚Äôve been active in the Apache Answer project.</p>
    <p>In addition, I continue to contribute to projects such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/laravel/octane">laravel/octane</a>:
        Supercharge the performance of your Laravel application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hyperf/hyperf">hyperf</a>: High-performance
        coroutine framework based on PHP Swoole.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify">docsify</a>: A magical
        documentation site generator.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/typecho/typecho">typecho</a>: A simple yet
        powerful blogging platform based on PHP.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simps/mqtt">simps/mqtt</a>: MQTT Protocol
        Analysis and Coroutine Client for PHP. Supports versions 3.1, 3.1.1, and
        5.0 of the MQTT protocol, including WebSocket support.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since PHP was the language that started my journey, I also contribute to
      the PHP ecosystem, including websites and Chinese documentation
      translations.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-main-challenges-you-face-as-a-maintainer">
      What are the main challenges you face as a maintainer?
    </h2>
    <p>As a maintainer, I face several challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Time Management: Balancing project maintenance with a busy work and
        personal life schedule.
      </li>
      <li>
        Community Management: Handling feedback from community members and
        ensuring the community remains active and healthy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Contributors or maintainers may sometimes move on due to changes in their
      work or technical interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking docsify as an example ‚Äî even though core maintainers are still
      around, the update frequency and responsiveness have slowed compared to a
      few years ago, making it difficult to release new versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sincerely hope that more fresh contributors will join and help
      revitalize the docsify project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidentally, I‚Äôm also pushing for a new release of docsify in Maintainer
      Month, which can be experienced at https://preview.docsifyjs.org/.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I make time during my workday to check GitHub notifications and
      emails from Gmail, trying to balance my main job while also staying active
      in the Open Source community.
    </p>
    <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      From an ordinary user to a project maintainer, this journey has brought me
      growth, friendships, and a sense of accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am deeply grateful to the Open Source community for the support and
      opportunities it has given me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to continuing this journey alongside more passionate and
      like-minded friends.
