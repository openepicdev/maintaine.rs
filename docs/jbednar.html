      I am the original founder of the
      <a href="https://holoviz.org/">HoloViz.org</a> project, which provides
      Open Source Python libraries for scientific, engineering, and analytical
      data exploration and visualization,
      <a href="https://pyviz.org/">PyViz.org</a>, which catalogs all the open
      visualization tools available for Python, and
      <a href="https://pandata.pydata.org/">Pandata.PyData.org</a>, which
      provides a curated set of highly scalable data processing tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a vocal proponent of Open Source since grad school in the
      1990s, where I embraced the new (and still quite rough!) Linux operating
      system and GCC compiler. My goal was to ensure that my research software
      would be reproducible by anyone, without any restrictions. Approximately
      fifteen people ever tried to use any of that esoteric brain simulation
      code, but I kept focusing on open science when those around me were locked
      into proprietary tools that I felt were not worth that loss of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I became a computer-science professor in 2004, I embraced Python and
      taught courses arguing that Open Source and flexible ‚Äúscripting languages‚Äù
      like Python were the way we could finally achieve the still-elusive goal
      of software reuse (instead of starting every new system from scratch!).
      However, I felt like a curmudgeon shaking his fist at the sky, with those
      fanciful ideals seemingly impossibly far away from reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two decades later, nearly every cloud computer runs Linux, and Python is
      now the most popular computing language in the world. Instead of starting
      from scratch, it is now the norm to stitch a large collection of libraries
      into a complete Python or Javascript system, requiring very little new
      code. Open Source won, and software reuse is real! I feel privileged to
      have witnessed such a profound shift in how software is written and used.
      Today‚Äôs scientists and engineers no longer have to choose between a
      proprietary platform with hard-coded functionality, or else writing entire
      systems from scratch in a language like C (like I had to do as a young
      researcher).
    </p>
    <p>
      My own group‚Äôs Open Source tools started out modest, with
      <a href="https://param.holoviz.org/">Param.HoloViz.org</a> starting in
      2003 to help make our brain simulator have modular, well-defined software
      interfaces, and <a href="https://holoviews.org">HoloViews.org</a> joining
      it in 2010 to make it easier to use
      <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> for complex
      multi-dimensional data. Our tools were easy to distribute since they were
      pure Python, but they needed to be combined with C or Fortran libraries
      like <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> to do any real work, which
      limited their use to old coders like myself who could compile those
      languages. <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda.com</a> started to
      change that in 2012, providing pre-compiled libraries that allowed
      numerical computing in Python to really take off.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2015 I had left academia along with three of my former Ph.D.¬†students
      and we all joined Anaconda‚Äôs consulting group, which let us focus on our
      Open Source tools nearly full time, instead of working on them when they
      were meant to be writing papers and grant proposals. For each customer, we
      now walk in with deep expertise on Python‚Äôs Open Source tools, offering to
      quickly put together solutions reusing existing libraries to save them
      time and money. We then pitch the customer on new Open Source capabilities
      that we propose to add to the open tooling so that they can use the new
      features without needing to maintain the tools, and so that they can later
      take advantage of advances funded by other customers. In client project
      after client project, we have steadily expanded our tools to include
      <a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/">Panel.HoloViz.org</a> for building
      web apps in Python,
      <a href="https://datashader.org/">Datashader.org</a> for rendering
      enormous datasets,
      <a href="https://colorcet.holoviz.org/">Colorcet.HoloViz.org</a> for
      perceptually accurate colormaps,
      <a href="https://hvplot.holoviz.org/">hvPlot.HoloViz.org</a> for quickly
      exploring data, <a href="https://geoviews.org/">GeoViews.org</a> for
      working with Earth-centered data, and now
      <a href="https://lumen.holoviz.org/">Lumen.HoloViz.org</a> for exploring
      data using natural human language thanks to large language models (LLMs).
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in there we introduced the name HoloViz to group these libraries
      together and show that they are all maintained as a group, and created
      HoloViz.org and
      <a href="https://examples.holoviz.org/gallery/index.html"
        >Examples.HoloViz.org</a
      >
      to show how to use them all together. HoloViz is now a
      <a href="https://numfocus.org">NumFocus</a> sponsored project, ensuring
      that it will stay free and open forever. Outside of HoloViz, the Python
      software ecosystem become so diverse and complex that we also needed to
      create <a href="https://pyviz.org">PyViz.org</a> as an unopinionated
      overview to make sense of what became <em>hundreds</em> of visualization
      libraries for Python. The dashboarding and web applications section of
      PyViz.org went from four tools at the beginning of PyViz to now
      <em>dozens</em> of competing libraries. In my career, we have gone from
      having no software available to reuse, to having software but having to
      struggle to build and connect it together, to today‚Äôs problems of having
      to choose between so many confusing options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, our tools ended up having a real impact, far beyond our
      original academic community. Param was used only in our brain simulation
      framework for its first ten years of life, but it is now downloaded from
      PyPI and anaconda.org over a million times each month. All told, the
      HoloViz tools are downloaded ten million times a month, compared to maybe
      a single thousand people who have ever read my academic books or papers.
      Open Source has had a much more profound impact than just about anything
      else I have done in my professional career. What a journey it has been!

      Panel and HoloViews), Jefferson Provost and Chris Ball (the original
      authors of Param), and all the many other members of the HoloViz team past
      and present.
