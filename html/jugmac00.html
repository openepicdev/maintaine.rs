<p>Hi, my name is <a href="https://github.com/jugmac00">Jürgen Gmach</a>, and I am an open-source advocate by heart.</p>
<p>Although I started writing code already at the age of 13 (generation C64), and I have been a professional software engineer since 2007, I only started contributing to open-source software a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>While I had been using many open-source applications and tools like Drupal, WordPress, Roundcube, Dovecot, Postfix, Apache, Nginx, PHP, Python, and a few Linux distributions for several years, I never felt the need or the urge to contribute to them - they just worked.</p>
<h2 id="turning-point">Turning point</h2>
<p>Things changed when I became the maintainer of a 14-year-old custom intranet application built on the Zope / Python 2 stack. Python 2 support ended in 2020, which meant I needed to migrate the application to Python 3. The problem was that there was no Python 3 version available for Zope.</p>
<p>As a team of one, migrating both the application and the Zope framework was a mission impossible.</p>
<h2 id="but-zope-is-open-source-software">… But Zope is open-source software</h2>
<p>Luckily, Zope is both open-source software and was still used by a couple of companies, which funded a series of sprints, where dozens of developers from diverse companies and organizations came together and with combined efforts over several years, successfully ported Zope to Python 3. An open-source success story!</p>
<h2 id="this-was-only-the-beginning">This was only the beginning</h2>
<p>During the migration, we needed to make sure that Zope is both working on Python 2 and 3 at the same time. As we had to migrate around 300 libraries, it was a real pain to create and update separate environments for Python 2 and 3 for each of them.</p>
<p>During the sprint, I learned about a tool that automatically creates different environments for your libraries and runs the test suite for each configuration. The tool is called <a href="https://tox.wiki/en/latest/">tox</a>, and I immediately fell in love with it.</p>
<p>tox (always lowercase, even at the beginning of a sentence) had a few issues and rough edges, so at first I created several issues on its bug tracker, but after a while, I felt this relentless urge to give something back. At first I started looking through all the reported issues of the project, to get an overview of what needed to be done, closed a couple of already fixed issues, and then I just started working on tickets - one after another. The code base used bleeding-edge tools and Python versions, and I got invaluable feedback on my pull requests from a very experienced engineer. I just could not stop anymore.</p>
<h2 id="congratulations">Congratulations</h2>
<p>After a while, the maintainer of tox announced me as a maintainer myself!</p>
<p>I could not believe it, becoming the maintainer of a tool, which offers so much value, which gets downloaded more than 20 million times a month, and which is used both across other high-profile open-source projects and multi-billion dollar companies alike.</p>
<p>Being the maintainer of such a high-profile tool might have also had a big impact when I successfully applied at Canonical. Meanwhile, I work full time on Open Source helping to maintain Ubuntu, one of the most popular Linux distributions of our time. I also contributed to several hundreds of open source projects to a varying degree, and I am a frequent speaker at conferences, where I share my experience and try to remove the barriers for others to become part of the Open Source success story.</p>
<h2 id="maintainer-woes">Maintainer woes</h2>
<p>Being a maintainer of a high-profile open-source application such as tox is not always shiny. You need to manage your time and the expectations of your users.</p>
<p>There is always the decision of whether I should fix the latest reported bug, or spend time with my family.</p>
<p>Users of your open-source applications are humans, too, and as such there are also not so friendly ones. Several times I faced angry users who complained about a bug, or who insisted heavily on new features or requested help to debug their 500 lines configuration file for their multi-billion dollar company.</p>
<p>At this time, I read the blog post <a href="https://www.softwaremaxims.com/blog/not-a-supplier">I am not your supplier</a>, which resonated with me and helped me prioritize the important things in life.</p>
<h2 id="free-lunch-is-over">Free lunch is over</h2>
<p>While you can handle overambitious requests more easily, it is another thing to receive a security issue - especially when you are busy in life with other things.</p>
<p>Then you need to have the ability to defer work to other maintainers and ask for help in the community.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>When it comes to security, we both apply the best practices like two-factor authentication, using security linters, and so on, at some point you need to rely on others.</p>
<p>For tox we make heavy use of the security features offered by GitHub, that is e.g. <a href="https://github.com/dependabot">Dependabot</a> which helps with keeping the dependencies secure, which is one of the greatest challenges in today’s security landscape. Supply-chain attacks are a real threat.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do">What you can do</h2>
<p>I love being an open-source maintainer, getting in touch with users across the world, and knowing my contribution helps tens of thousands of users.</p>
<p>As an open-source user, you can do a couple of things. The most obvious one is certainly helping to fund the project, either directly or via your employer which relies on the project. Even the smallest contribution counts.</p>
<p>But there are many other ways. Take great care when creating issues, e.g. making it as easy as possible for the maintainers to reproduce a bug.</p>
<p>Even if you are a happy user, and you do not need a bug fix or a new feature, reach out to the maintainer of your favorite project and say “Thank you!”. This will conjure a smile on the maintainer’s face - I know firsthand.</p>
<p>Please never forget, that even with all the anonymity the web offers, at the very end, a maintainer is still a human. Be kind. Be friendly. Be part of the open-source movement.</p>
