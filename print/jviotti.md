Hey there! I'm Juan Cruz Viotti[^122]. I'm a
member of the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee, O'Reilly author
(Unifying Business Data and Code: Designing Data Products with JSON
Schema[^102]),
award-winning University of Oxford alumnus, and founder of
Sourcemeta[^105], my tiny company where I work in open
source for a living.

Some of my notable Open Source current work includes
Blaze[^104], a high-performance C++ JSON
Schema validator, a JSON Schema CLI[^121]
designed for maintaining large JSON Schema ontologies, the Learn JSON
Schema[^106] popular documentation site, and JSON
BinPack[^120], an on-going research
project for space-efficient IoT data transfer. I also help co-organising the
JSON Schema track[^119] within the API
Days[^118] Conference and I've been a mentor in Google
Summer of Code a couple of times now.

You may also know me as the original author of
Etcher[^117], plus I've been casually involved
in many other projects in the past, such as helping architect the Node.js
Single Executable Application[^116]
initiative.

## It all started with Open Source

Many professional software engineers have asked me for advice on how to get
involved in Open Source. But for me, it was the other way around: Open Source
is what gave me a career.

As a kid growing up in Argentina, I loved building things and tearing them
apart. Of course, it was no different when we got our first family computer.
After overly fiddling with it and making it unusable for others several times,
I got my own, which only made the fiddling problem a lot worse.

Computer magazines and the Internet quickly introduced me to GNU/Linux and the
Open Source philosophy. Back then, Ubuntu was gaining attention and Canonical
was mailing live CDs for
free[^115] to
boost adoption. I never thought it would make it through customs to a 12 years
old kid, but it did. I remember having to reassure my mother that it was
nothing dodgy and that I had not somehow spent any money on it without her
permission.

It is hard to use GNU/Linux without being exposed to source code, which got me
excited about programming. For years, I was hanging out at IRC servers trying
to send patches to arbitrary projects and reading every programming book I
could get my hands on. Most of those books were from O'Reilly, and seeing my
name on an O'Reilly cover now always gives me a ton of flashbacks.

When I was around 16 years old, GitHub was gaining popularity. I joined early
on and started publishing a lot of random projects, ranging from C experiments
with UNIX sockets to my own Linux package manager. To my surprise, people
reached out and I landed a few contracting gigs with some overseas startups. As
a 17 years old teen, I couldn't take international wire transfers under my
name, so I took Bitcoin (and made good money when Bitcoin exploded some time
later!)

Soon after I turned 18, I opened a bank account and landed my first proper
full-time job as an adult at a tiny London-based company that would eventually
become Balena[^114], a well known multinational IoT startup
valued at $558M with $101M in
funding[^113].
It was a hell of a roller coaster (in a positive way!), and my experience
there serving as an Engineering Lead taught me many valuable lessons. Of
course, Balena is almost entirely open
source[^112].

## From Open Source hacker to founder

Thanks to Balena, I eventually moved to England, and as a Harry Potter fan (who
read the series too many times), I was thrilled when I was accepted to the
University of Oxford. I spent my time there studying formal methods,
mathematical proofs, formal specifications like the Z
Notation[^111],
and formal concurrency models like
CSP[^110].
Hint: JSON Schema is not too different from these things!

By the end of my degree, my dissertation focused on the use of expressive
schema languages to derive binary serialisation rules for higher compression
when transmitting telemetry data over 5G and satellite. The result was JSON
BinPack[^109], an experimental open-source
binary serialisation format based in JSON Schema that proved to be more
efficient than every other tested alternative in every single tested case. I
was awarded the CAR Hoare Prize for the best dissertation and resulting
project.

While wrapping up at the University of Oxford, I started contracting at
Postman[^108], a popular company in the API space. In a
twist of serendipity, Postman started employing JSON Schema core
contributors[^107]
as a way to sponsor their work. After my previous research around JSON Schema,
this fueled my involvement there even more, and I eventually joined the JSON
Schema Technical Steering Committee.

My official JSON Schema membership and my recently published O'Reilly book
touching on JSON Schema (Unifying Business Data and Code: Designing Data
Products with JSON
Schema[^102])
led me to various engagements with companies that were part of the community.
This gave me additional firsthand experience on how substandard the ecosystem
was for use cases beyond trivial.

For example, validating a simple configuration file is easy. But properly
pulling off a large-scale schema ontology or API Governance program was
borderline impossible from a tooling point of view. Educational resources were
lacking too. Before I kickstarted Learn JSON
Schema[^106], there was no reference documentation
for JSON Schema at all. You had to read and grok the specifications, which was
no easy task.

I saw this gap as a great opportunity to capitalize on my own self-funded
company: Sourcemeta[^105]. Balena taught me how
customers can see Open Source as a competitive advantage, and of course, I
embraced the same principle at Sourcemeta.

## The future is Open Source

JSON Schema is one of the most ubiquitous technologies I saw in a while. It is
everywhere, from Fortune 100 companies and scientific institutions all the way
to governments and early stage tech startups.

At Sourcemeta, our goal is simple: we want to provide the very best
enterprise-grade tooling and services across the entire JSON Schema ecosystem.
All our offerings, including the fastest schema validator available in the
market[^104] and an upcoming self-hostable
schema registry[^103], are publicly
available on GitHub under the
[AGPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) and a non-copy-left
licensing model that guarantees our sustainability.

JSON Schema itself is Open Source. Sourcemeta offerings not only help our users
get more out of JSON Schema, but also help fund my own continued work in the
JSON Schema Open Source organisation. It works out because they both feed into
each other.

Finally, I believe that Open Source is not a philosophy. It is what makes
software powerful, and that is why we need more people working in Open Source.
However, donations is not a sustainable model and we don't do ourselves a
favour by portraying Open Source as charity. Instead, I encourage entrepreneurs
to build commercial Open Source products, and users to prefer buying from open
source vendors. Together, we can create a market where Open Source is the
rule, and not the exception.

After all, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Open Source.
