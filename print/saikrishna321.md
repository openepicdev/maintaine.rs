Hi\! I’m Sai Krishna (Director of Engineering, LambdaTest), an open-source contributor and maintainer with over a decade of experience. My journey began as an OSS user, overcoming the difficulties associated with mobile test automation. Witnessing firsthand how open-source tools empower the community sparked a deep interest in giving back. That’s where my journey truly started. Since then, I’ve contributed to and maintained key projects like Appium, co-created tools like AppiumTestDistribution (ATD), and actively mentored the next generation of testers. For me, Open Source isn’t just about code. It’s about creating impact through community collaboration.

## **1\. How did you get involved with Open Source?**

Like many others, I started as an open-source user. As I relied on tools like Appium in my day-to-day testing efforts, I realized how these community-built tools made life easier for so many. That realization inspired me to contribute back. I began small, triaging issues and writing documentation, and gradually moved toward contributing code. Over time, I got involved in projects like Appium, Selenium, and ATD, eventually taking on maintainer roles to help shape the direction of the tools I once just used.

## **2\. What’s Open Source to you?**

Open Source is a shared responsibility and a powerful force for innovation. It’s not just about software. It’s about enabling communities to solve problems together. Whether it’s writing code, reviewing pull requests, improving documentation, or guiding a first-time contributor, Open Source thrives when we build with the community, not just for it.

## **3\. What projects are you involved in?**

- **Appium Java Client**: Focused on plugin architecture and improving parallel test support.

- **AppiumTestDistribution (ATD)**: Co-created to address parallel execution challenges in mobile and IoT testing.

- **Selenium / Taiko**: Contributed to enhancing developer ergonomics and cross-browser testing stability.

- **Appium Plugins**: Developed several plugins to simplify and extend Appium capabilities:  
   • Appium Device Farm  
   • Appium Gestures Plugin  
   • Appium Wait Plugin

- **Appium Conference**: Active participant and advocate for sharing best practices and building global tester communities.

## **4\. How do you grow your community?**

- **Listen and Adapt**: ATD was shaped by community feedback, such as adding remote device execution support for distributed teams.

- **Simplify Onboarding**: Built tools like `appium-installer` to make setup easy for newcomers.

- **Accelerate Go to Market**: Appium Device Farm enables organizations to quickly set up scalable mobile device grids for automated testing. This helps improve device coverage, accelerate feedback, and reduce time to market.

- **Events and Outreach**: Conduct webinars, workshops, and community calls to connect with testers and developers.

- **Documentation First**: Clear and actionable guides are a top priority to help contributors ramp up quickly.

## **5\. Main Challenges as a Maintainer**

- **Burnout and Sustainability**: Balancing a full-time job with OSS commitments requires careful management.

- **Technical Debt**: Evolving architectures while keeping backward compatibility is complex.

- **Security Oversight**: Staying ahead of vulnerabilities in dependencies is a continuous effort.

- **Succession Planning**: Building a pipeline of contributors who can take over when needed is essential for long-term project health.

## **6\. How Contributors Can Support Maintainers**

- **Non-Code Help**: Contribute to documentation, triage issues, or mentor first-time contributors.

- **Sponsorships**: Encourage organizations to support OSS via GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective.

- **Be Proactive**: Submit detailed bug reports and well-crafted pull requests, and respect maintainers' time.

- **Security Mindset**: Assist with implementing reproducible builds, static analysis tools, and secure development pipelines.

## **7\. Key Security Practices**

- **Automated Scanning**: Integrated static analysis and dependency scanning into CI/CD workflows.

- **Manual Reviews**: Maintained strong code review practices to catch subtle vulnerabilities.

- **Reproducible Builds**: Adopted to ensure traceability and auditability across key projects.

- **Community Awareness**: Hosted regular sessions on secure coding and testing for mobile and web ecosystems.

## **8\. Impact of AI on Open Source**

- **Faster Innovation**: AI tools like code assistants and CI copilots boost productivity and accessibility in Open Source.

- **New Risks**: AI-generated code introduces concerns around licensing, bias, and reproducibility.

- **Upskilling**: Developers with AI and Open Source experience are in high demand. AI knowledge is becoming essential for modern maintainers.

## **9\. Advice for Maintainers**

- **Mentor Early**: Invest time in contributors who can grow into future maintainers.

- **Use Metrics**: Track pull request volume, response time, and contributor engagement to identify gaps.

- **Automate Everything**: Leverage bots, scripts, and CI tools to reduce fatigue and focus on strategic efforts.

- **Be Community-Driven**: Focus on solving real pain points. ATD succeeded by addressing everyday mobile testing challenges.

## **Final Thoughts**

Open Source is built on invisible work: code reviews, mentorship, documentation, and triage. That work deserves recognition and support. As the landscape evolves and AI plays a bigger role, maintainers must innovate while staying sustainable and inclusive. The future of Open Source depends on shared responsibility and visible maintainership.
