Hi\! I’m Srinivasan Sekar, Director of Engineering at LambdaTest and an Open Source contributor/maintainer. My journey began 8–9 years ago when I struggled with flaky mobile test automation pipelines in Appium. Determined to fix this, I contributed my first patch to improve its CI system—and discovered the power of collaborative problem-solving. Today, I maintain tools like Appium Java Client, co-created AppiumTestDistribution (ATD) for parallel testing, and lead the Appium Conference. Beyond code, I mentor testers, blog at [srini.codes](https://srini.codes), and build plugins to simplify workflows.

For me, Open Source means “building with, not just for” the community.

## **1\. How did you get involved with Open Source?**

As an Appium user, I faced constant CI failures during mobile test runs. Instead of waiting for fixes, I dove into the codebase to stabilize the pipelines. That first success seeing my contribution benefit others hooked me. Over time, I expanded my work to projects like Selenium, Taiko, and ATD, transitioning from contributor to maintainer to member as I focused on systemic issues like parallel testing bottlenecks.

## **2\. What’s Open Source to you?**

Open Source is a **force multiplier** for innovation. It’s about democratizing technology, fostering collective ownership, and empowering communities to solve real-world problems. For me, it’s not just code, it's mentorship, documentation, and creating tools like ATD to simplify complex workflows for thousands of developers globally.

---

## **3\. What projects are you involved in?**

- **Appium Java Client**: Enhanced parallel testing capabilities and plugin ecosystems.
- **AppiumTestDistribution (ATD)**: Co-founded to solve parallel execution challenges in mobile testing, later expanding to IoT.
- **Selenium/Taiko**: Contributions to test frameworks and community-driven tooling.
- **Appium Conference**: Co-Founded to unite global testing enthusiasts and share best practices.
- **Appium Plugins:** Developed a bunch a Appium plugins to help ease development efforts
  - Appium Device Farm
  - Appium Gestures Plugin
  - Appium Wait Plugin

---

## **4\. How do you grow your community?**

- **Listening First**: ATD evolved based on user feedback (e.g., remote device execution for distributed teams).
- **Accessible Onboarding**: Created plugins like appium-installer to simplify environment setup.
- **Events & Advocacy**: Hosting conferences, AMA sessions, and workshops to engage testers globally.
- **Documentation**: Prioritized clear guides to lower entry barriers for new contributors.

---

## **5\. Main Challenges as a Maintainer**

- **Burnout & Sustainability**: Balancing maintenance with full-time roles, especially as projects scale.
- **Technical Debt**: Evolving architectures (e.g., Appium’s shift to plugin-based systems) while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Security Oversight**: Managing vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Succession Planning**: Ensuring continuity when key contributors step down.

---

## **6\. How Contributors Can Support Maintainers**

- **Non-Code Contributions**: Improve documentation, triage issues, or mentor newcomers.
- **Financial Backing**: Advocate for corporate sponsorships or Open Collective funding.
- **Proactive Engagement**: Submit reproducible bug reports and respect maintainers’ time.
- **Security Advocacy**: Help implement SAST/SCA tools and reproducible builds.

---

## **7\. Key Security Practices**

- **Automated Tooling**: Integrated SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and dependency scanning into CI/CD.
- **Manual Code Reviews**: Maintained a good manual review rate to catch nuanced vulnerabilities.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Adopted in almost all of the projects to ensure traceability.
- **Community Education**: Hosted sessions on secure testing practices for mobile ecosystems.

---

## **8\. Impact of AI on Open Source**

- **Accelerated Development**: Tools like Cline, Roo integrated with Models like Claude, etc increases productivity and reduce costs which enable SMEs to innovate.
- **New Challenges**: Increased security risks (e.g., IP infringement, model bias) requiring guardrails.
- **Skill Demand**: Most developers value Open Source AI experience, creating upskilling opportunities.

---

## **9\. Advice for Maintainers**

- **Build a Bench**: Actively mentor successors to reduce risks.
- **Leverage Metrics**: Track Contributor Confidence and PR distribution to identify gaps.
- **Automate Relentlessly**: Reduce fatigue through CI/CD pipelines and bot-assisted triage.
- **Stay Community-First**: Prioritize user needs over “shiny” features—ATD’s success stemmed from solving real-world parallel testing pain points.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

Open Source thrives on **visible maintenance** and **shared responsibility**. As AI reshapes our ecosystem, maintainers must balance innovation with sustainability—whether through smarter funding models or inclusive community design. Let’s make the invisible work of maintainers _seen_ and _supported_.
