During the month of May 2025, I’ve had the privilege of keeping in touch with the top maintainers across the Open Source ecosystem and reviewing their stories to share with the wider community as part of GitHub’s [Maintainer Month](https://maintainermonth.github.com/) campaign.

Reading these stories left me feeling deeply grateful and inspired. These maintainers not only write code, review issues, and merge pull requests—they also navigate community dynamics, mentor new contributors, and increasingly adopt security best practices to protect their code and users. They literally keep the digital infrastructure up and running for the benefit of all.

From the various back-and-forth messages with these maintainers, I was struck by their kindness and dedication, which filled my heart with hope and optimism. One message from Niklas Merz stayed with me:

> After many years of doing Open Source and some periods with tiresome work, low recognition and motivation, small things like this help to relight the fire we all feel for Open Source. The opportunity to share our stories for Maintainer Month certainly had a great impact.

I hope this collection of stories brings you the same sense of appreciation and hope it brought me. Whether you're a maintainer yourself or someone who benefits from their work, may these stories help you see the people behind the code—and inspire you to celebrate and support them.

These stories are a testament to the quiet heroism at the heart of Open Source. Behind every project we rely on are people who choose to show up—not for profit or fame, but for the love of building, solving problems, and sharing solutions. Their work ripples outward, enabling innovation across industries and connecting communities across the globe. In a world often driven by short-term gains, maintainers remind us of the enduring power of generosity, collaboration, and purpose.

Let’s amplify their voices! Together, we can ensure maintainers receive the recognition, support, and resources they need—not only in May, but all year long.
